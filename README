README
======

This is mcmapper, it generates images of Minecraft[1] maps.

Building
--------

To build from source, you need Maven 2.

Run mvn assembly:assembly to build a jar with dependencies bundled.

The jar target/mcmapper-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar is an executable jar.

On OS X it will automatically build an app package.

To run, you need Java 6.

Why another version?
--------------------

Because I can. Also because I wanted to learn Maven. Now people around the world
can marvel at my ineptitude.

Alternatives
------------

 * Cartograph for OS X (uses CoreImage instead of Corona)[2]
 * Cartograph cleaned up[3]
 * Pynemap[4]

Thanks
------

Thanks to Zombuster for Cartograph[5].

I took the colors and the "cartograph-like" rendering code from Cartograph.
